Our best value of T is 25.

We didn't use any tie breakers. This is because it's not clear what feature is the best, so we just rely on whatever has the highest goodness metric so far.

We stopped when we were out of features or examples or if all the labels were the same in the training data.

We didn't deviate from the method suggested too much, but we didn't incorporate depth when determing when to stop building the tree.
